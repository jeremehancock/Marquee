## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Plex item mapping
The system SHALL record, for each stored poster, the Plex item it came from (by
rating key) together with the Plex library section that item belongs to, the
item's Plex "added at" timestamp, the item's release year where Plex reports one,
and — for seasons — the Plex season number, so later operations can address the
item for artwork, locking, and label edits, so the gallery can order posters by
when their media was added to Plex, and so a poster search can be built from
recorded facts rather than re-parsed from a display title. On re-import the system
SHALL overwrite the same poster file rather than creating a duplicate.

#### Scenario: Re-import overwrites, not duplicates
- **WHEN** a user imports a library and later imports it again
- **THEN** each item's poster is updated in place and no duplicate poster is
  created

#### Scenario: Section recorded on import
- **WHEN** an item is imported from a Plex library
- **THEN** the system stores that library's section identifier with the item's
  poster mapping

#### Scenario: Added-at recorded on import
- **WHEN** an item that reports a Plex "added at" timestamp is imported
- **THEN** the system stores that timestamp with the item's poster mapping so it
  can order the gallery by date added

#### Scenario: Missing added-at does not fail import
- **WHEN** an item does not report a Plex "added at" timestamp
- **THEN** the import still records the mapping and the poster remains browsable

#### Scenario: Release year recorded on import
- **WHEN** a movie or show that reports a release year is imported
- **THEN** the system stores that year with the item's poster mapping

#### Scenario: Season number recorded on import
- **WHEN** a TV season is imported
- **THEN** the system stores the Plex season number for that season with the
  item's poster mapping, including zero for a Specials season

#### Scenario: Missing year or season number does not fail import
- **WHEN** an item does not report a release year, or is not a season and so has
  no season number
- **THEN** the import still records the mapping and the poster remains browsable

#### Scenario: Existing mappings gain the new facts on re-import
- **WHEN** a library imported by an earlier version of Marquee is imported again
- **THEN** the stored mappings are updated with the release year and season number
  without requiring the user to delete or rebuild anything
