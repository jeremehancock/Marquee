## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The poster search service is named to users
The product documentation SHALL identify posteria.app as the hosted poster
search service that backs Find Posters, as a general statement only — it SHALL
NOT document the service's endpoints, request or response formats, or internal
behavior, and it SHALL NOT elaborate on running or self-hosting the service.

#### Scenario: README names the service
- **WHEN** a reader reviews the README's description of Find Posters
- **THEN** posteria.app is named as the service the search runs against

#### Scenario: No implementation detail is published
- **WHEN** the documentation describes the poster search service
- **THEN** it states only what the service provides, not how it is called or
  how it produces its results

#### Scenario: No self-hosting guidance
- **WHEN** the documentation describes the poster search service
- **THEN** it does not invite the reader to run their own instance or explain
  how to point Marquee at one
- **AND** `POSTER_SOURCE_URL` remains documented in the configuration table as
  an ordinary setting, without such guidance attached
