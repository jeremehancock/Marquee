## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Persisted state is recreatable
Everything Marquee persists SHALL be recreatable from Plex: the poster files
under the posters directory and the SQLite database under the data directory
together form a cache of Plex's artwork and of the mapping back to the Plex items
it came from. Removing either SHALL return Marquee to its first-run state rather
than a broken one — the system SHALL recreate the database schema and any missing
directory on demand, without manual repair and without a reinstall.

The one thing this invariant does not preserve is artwork that never left
Marquee. A poster the user applied to an item was uploaded to Plex and locked
there, so a later import brings it back; a poster only ever stored locally has no
upstream copy and is gone. That boundary is what makes a hand-run reset safe to
document, so the system MUST NOT begin persisting state that only exists locally
and cannot be rebuilt from Plex.

#### Scenario: Database removed
- **WHEN** the SQLite database file is deleted while the container is stopped and
  Marquee is started again
- **THEN** the system recreates the schema on first use and serves pages normally
- **AND** a subsequent import rebuilds the Plex item mappings from scratch

#### Scenario: Posters directory removed
- **WHEN** the posters directory or one of its category directories is missing
- **THEN** the gallery reports that category as empty rather than failing
- **AND** the next import recreates the directory and stores posters into it

#### Scenario: Reset returns art that Plex holds
- **WHEN** a user removes both the posters directory and the database, restarts,
  and runs an import
- **THEN** every poster the user had previously sent to Plex is imported back,
  because Plex holds and locks that artwork
