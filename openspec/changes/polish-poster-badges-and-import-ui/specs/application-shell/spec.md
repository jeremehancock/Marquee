## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Consistent custom tooltips
Tooltips across the application SHALL be rendered by a single themed custom
tooltip component rather than the browser's native `title=` tooltip, so hint text
matches the app's look and can display content the native tooltip cannot present
well (such as a poster's full title). Any element that offers a tooltip SHALL
declare its text through a `data-tooltip` attribute, and the shared tooltip SHALL
appear on pointer hover and on keyboard focus for focusable targets, including
targets added to the page after load (e.g. via AJAX or client-side rendering).
Removing a native `title` from an icon-only control SHALL NOT remove that
control's accessible name — the name SHALL be preserved by an `aria-label`.

#### Scenario: Custom tooltip replaces the native tooltip
- **WHEN** a user hovers an element that offers a tooltip
- **THEN** the themed custom tooltip is shown and no separate native browser
  tooltip appears

#### Scenario: Tooltip works on keyboard focus
- **WHEN** a user moves keyboard focus to a focusable element that offers a
  tooltip
- **THEN** the custom tooltip is shown for that element

#### Scenario: Tooltip works on dynamically added content
- **WHEN** an element with a tooltip is added to the page after initial load
  (such as paginated results or client-rendered previews)
- **THEN** hovering it shows the custom tooltip just as for elements present at
  load

#### Scenario: Icon-only control keeps its accessible name
- **WHEN** an icon-only control that previously relied on a native `title` is
  converted to the custom tooltip
- **THEN** the control still exposes an accessible name to assistive technology
