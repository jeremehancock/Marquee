# Poster Library Specification

## Purpose

The gallery: how stored posters are organized, listed, presented, and acted on.
Four fixed categories backed by directories on disk, paginated and sorted
listings, protected image serving, and the interaction model that exposes each
poster's actions on both pointer and touch devices.

This capability owns *browsing and presenting* posters. Posters enter the
library through `plex-import`; operating on one poster is `poster-editing`;
filtering the listing is `search`.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Poster categories
The system SHALL organize posters into four fixed categories — Movies, TV Shows,
TV Seasons, and Collections — each backed by its own directory within the
posters storage location. In addition to the four categories, the system SHALL
accept the reserved slug `all` as an aggregate view over them (see the Aggregate
All view requirement).

#### Scenario: Known category is browsable
- **WHEN** a user opens a category by its slug (`movies`, `tv-shows`,
  `tv-seasons`, `collections`)
- **THEN** the system shows the gallery for that category

#### Scenario: Aggregate slug is browsable
- **WHEN** a user opens the reserved `all` slug
- **THEN** the system shows the combined gallery rather than responding 404

#### Scenario: Unknown category is rejected
- **WHEN** a user requests a slug that is neither one of the four categories nor
  the reserved `all` slug
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 404

### Requirement: Gallery listing with pagination
The system SHALL list the posters in a category as a gallery, ordered by a
stable sort, and split into pages of a configurable size (`IMAGES_PER_PAGE`).

#### Scenario: Posters are paginated
- **WHEN** a category contains more posters than the page size
- **THEN** the system shows only one page of posters and provides navigation to
  the other pages
- **AND** reports how many posters are shown out of the total

#### Scenario: Out-of-range page is clamped
- **WHEN** a user requests a page number beyond the last page
- **THEN** the system shows the last available page rather than an error

### Requirement: Article-aware ordering
The system SHALL sort posters by title, ignoring a leading article ("a", "an",
"the") when `IGNORE_ARTICLES_IN_SORT` is enabled.

#### Scenario: Leading article ignored in sort
- **WHEN** `IGNORE_ARTICLES_IN_SORT` is true and a poster titled "The Matrix"
  is sorted among others
- **THEN** it is ordered as if titled "Matrix"

### Requirement: Auth-protected image serving
The system SHALL serve poster image files only to authenticated users, with
caching headers, and SHALL never resolve a request outside the posters
directory. The rendered URL for a poster SHALL carry a version marker derived
from the file's modification time, so that replacing the file yields a different
URL. The system SHALL identify the requested image from the path alone and
SHALL ignore the version marker when serving.

#### Scenario: Authenticated image request succeeds
- **WHEN** an authenticated user requests an existing poster image
- **THEN** the system responds with the image bytes and an image content type

#### Scenario: Version marker is ignored when serving
- **WHEN** a poster image is requested with a version marker that is absent,
  outdated, or unrecognized
- **THEN** the system serves the poster currently on disk rather than failing or
  serving an earlier image

#### Scenario: Path traversal is refused
- **WHEN** a request for a poster image contains path separators or traversal
  sequences in the filename
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 404 and serves no file outside the
  posters directory

### Requirement: Poster presentation
The gallery SHALL show each poster's title in a caption beneath the poster, size
posters large enough for the overlay action stack to fit, and lazy-load images
with a subtle placeholder animation that resolves when the image loads. The
placeholder animation and fade-in SHALL apply on every page that renders poster
cards, not only the gallery, and SHALL resolve whether the image loads or fails.

#### Scenario: Title beneath the poster
- **WHEN** the gallery renders a poster
- **THEN** its title appears in a caption below the image rather than inside the
  hover overlay

#### Scenario: Lazy-load animation
- **WHEN** a poster image has not yet loaded
- **THEN** a subtle placeholder animation is shown and the image fades in once
  loaded

#### Scenario: Poster cards outside the gallery
- **WHEN** a page other than the gallery renders poster cards, such as the
  orphans page
- **THEN** each poster image fades in once loaded, rather than staying invisible
  behind a placeholder that animates indefinitely

#### Scenario: Image that fails to load
- **WHEN** a poster image request fails
- **THEN** the placeholder animation stops rather than continuing to suggest the
  image is still loading

### Requirement: Poster actions on pointer devices
On pointer (hover-capable) devices the gallery SHALL reveal a poster's action
overlay on hover, without the actions being clipped or hidden off-card, and
clicking the poster itself SHALL open it full screen.

#### Scenario: Hover reveals actions on desktop
- **WHEN** a user hovers a poster on a pointer device
- **THEN** the action overlay is shown

#### Scenario: Clicking opens full screen on desktop
- **WHEN** a user clicks a poster (not one of its action buttons) on a pointer
  device
- **THEN** the poster opens full screen

### Requirement: Poster actions on touch devices
On touch devices the poster actions SHALL be presented in a bottom action sheet
opened by tapping the poster, rather than overlaid on the poster itself, so every
action is shown at full size and none can be triggered by accident.

#### Scenario: Tapping a poster opens the action sheet
- **WHEN** a user taps a poster on a touch device
- **THEN** a sheet opens listing that poster's actions (change, send/fetch to
  Plex when linked, download, copy URL, full screen, delete) with its title

#### Scenario: No tap-through
- **WHEN** a user taps a poster on a touch device
- **THEN** the tap opens the sheet only and does not trigger any poster action

#### Scenario: Dismissing the sheet
- **WHEN** the user taps outside the sheet, presses Escape, or runs one of its
  actions
- **THEN** the sheet closes

### Requirement: Always-available Plex actions
For every poster linked to a Plex item, the gallery SHALL always offer Send to
Plex and Fetch from Plex, independent of whether the poster was recently changed.

#### Scenario: Linked poster always shows Plex actions
- **WHEN** the gallery renders a poster that is linked to a Plex item
- **THEN** both Send to Plex and Fetch from Plex are available for it

### Requirement: Responsive gallery layout
The gallery SHALL remain usable on small screens without horizontal overflow:
the category tabs — now including the All tab, five in total — scroll rather than
overflow or crowd the screen, toolbar controls wrap to their own rows, and
posters are sized so at least two fit per row on a phone. On a narrow screen the
tab strip SHALL lay the tabs out in a single horizontal row that scrolls
(rather than a wrapping grid), so adding the All tab does not push tabs off the
edge of the screen or leave an awkward orphaned row.

#### Scenario: No overflow on a phone
- **WHEN** the gallery is viewed on a narrow (phone-width) screen
- **THEN** the tabs, toolbar, and poster grid fit without horizontal page overflow

#### Scenario: Tabs fit on a phone
- **WHEN** the gallery is viewed on a narrow screen with all five tabs present
- **THEN** the tabs are laid out in a scrollable horizontal row without
  overflowing the page width or crowding the other controls

### Requirement: Fullscreen poster view
The system SHALL let a user view any gallery poster full screen.

#### Scenario: Open a poster full screen
- **WHEN** a user activates a poster in the gallery
- **THEN** the system displays that poster in a full-screen view

### Requirement: Delete a poster
The system SHALL allow an authenticated user to delete a poster from a category.

#### Scenario: Poster is deleted
- **WHEN** an authenticated user deletes an existing poster
- **THEN** the system removes the image file and it no longer appears in the
  gallery

### Requirement: Background poster updates
The gallery SHALL apply poster actions — change, send to Plex, fetch from Plex,
and delete — without reloading the whole page, refreshing only the grid and
reporting the outcome.

#### Scenario: Updating a poster refreshes only the grid
- **WHEN** a user changes, sends, fetches, or deletes a poster
- **THEN** the grid reflects the result and a short confirmation is shown, and
  the surrounding page is not reloaded

#### Scenario: Works without JavaScript
- **WHEN** a user performs a poster action with JavaScript disabled
- **THEN** the action still completes via a normal form submission

### Requirement: Modal confirmations
Destructive actions SHALL ask for confirmation through an in-app modal rather
than a native browser dialog.

#### Scenario: Confirm deleting a poster
- **WHEN** a user chooses to delete a poster
- **THEN** a confirmation modal appears and the poster is deleted only if the
  user confirms

#### Scenario: Confirm deleting all orphans
- **WHEN** a user chooses to delete all orphaned posters
- **THEN** a confirmation modal appears and the orphans are deleted only if the
  user confirms

### Requirement: Remembered library section
When a user leaves the gallery for the Orphans or Import pages, the system SHALL
return them to the library section they were last viewing, including the All
view. The All view is a rememberable section like any category.

#### Scenario: Return to the last section
- **WHEN** a user viewing a library section (a single category or All) opens
  Orphans or Import and then follows the back-to-library link
- **THEN** they return to the section they were viewing, not a different one

#### Scenario: Return to All
- **WHEN** a user viewing the All view opens Orphans or Import and then follows
  the back-to-library link
- **THEN** they return to the All view

### Requirement: Aggregate All view
The system SHALL provide an aggregate "All" view, addressed by the reserved slug
`all`, that lists posters from all four categories together in a single gallery.
The All view SHALL be the default landing view and the first tab in the category
strip; opening the site root SHALL take the user to the All view. The All view is
not a fifth stored category and has no directory of its own — it is a combined
listing over the four real categories.

#### Scenario: All view is browsable
- **WHEN** a user opens the `all` slug
- **THEN** the system shows a single gallery containing posters from every
  category

#### Scenario: All is the default landing view
- **WHEN** a user opens the site root
- **THEN** the system takes them to the All view rather than a single category

#### Scenario: All is the first tab
- **WHEN** the gallery renders its category tabs
- **THEN** an All tab appears first, ahead of Movies, TV Shows, TV Seasons, and
  Collections

#### Scenario: All view paginates the combined listing
- **WHEN** the combined listing contains more posters than the page size
- **THEN** the system shows one page of the combined posters and provides
  navigation to the other pages, reporting how many are shown out of the
  combined total

### Requirement: Aggregate view ordering
Within the All view the system SHALL order posters by title across all types
(mixed, not grouped by category), applying the same article-aware ordering used
elsewhere. When two posters have the same sort title, the system SHALL break the
tie by category in the order Movies, TV Shows, TV Seasons, Collections, so the
order is stable and deterministic.

#### Scenario: Titles are mixed across types
- **WHEN** the All view lists posters of different categories
- **THEN** they are ordered together by title rather than grouped into
  per-category blocks

#### Scenario: Equal titles break ties by category
- **WHEN** two posters in the All view share the same sort title but belong to
  different categories
- **THEN** they are ordered by category in the sequence Movies, TV Shows,
  TV Seasons, Collections

### Requirement: Type badge in the aggregate view
In the All view the system SHALL display a small type badge on each poster
indicating its category (Movie, TV Show, TV Season, or Collection). On pointer
(hover-capable) devices the badge SHALL hide while the poster's action overlay is
shown, so it does not obscure or compete with the actions. On touch devices,
where the overlay is not used, the badge SHALL remain visible. Type badges SHALL
appear only in the All view; single-category views SHALL NOT show them.

#### Scenario: Badge shows the poster's type in All
- **WHEN** the All view renders a poster
- **THEN** a badge on the poster identifies its category as Movie, TV Show,
  TV Season, or Collection

#### Scenario: Badge hides on hover on pointer devices
- **WHEN** a user hovers a poster in the All view on a pointer device and the
  action overlay is revealed
- **THEN** the type badge is hidden while the overlay is shown

#### Scenario: Badge persists on touch
- **WHEN** the All view is viewed on a touch device
- **THEN** the type badge stays visible on each poster

#### Scenario: No badge in single-category views
- **WHEN** a single category (Movies, TV Shows, TV Seasons, or Collections) is
  viewed
- **THEN** no type badge is shown on its posters

### Requirement: Poster actions keyed by category in the aggregate view
Because poster filenames are unique only within a category, in the All view the
system SHALL identify each poster by its category together with its filename, and
every poster action — change, send to Plex, fetch from Plex, download, copy URL,
full screen, and delete — SHALL act on the poster's own category rather than a
single page-wide category. The change-poster modal opened for a poster SHALL
operate on that poster's category.

#### Scenario: An action targets the poster's own category
- **WHEN** a user runs an action on a poster in the All view
- **THEN** the action is applied to that poster within its own category, even if
  another category contains a poster with the same filename

#### Scenario: Change modal uses the poster's category
- **WHEN** a user opens the change-poster modal for a poster in the All view and
  applies a new image
- **THEN** the change is applied to that poster within its own category
